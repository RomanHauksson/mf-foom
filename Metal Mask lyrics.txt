Metal mask give him bad brains, pain man can't explain
Got locked up like a zoo monkey, then poof! Freedom
Got loose, left the cell, started rockin fools clean
Like a hill of beans, beans, no pan dulce
The rap game is like the seventh seal, it's so real
He hide behind a mask like a child, it's cold steel
No regrets, he do what he gotta and he peep this
I hold this, zap! Straight out the box, no joke
Deadly as a runaway stampede or lightning bolt in Summertime
Big as a Bumblebee sting and quicker to bring strife
Through the big speakers, sound bombs, ignite drama
On my A-game, I be straight sniper, through your eye likeGrey's Anatomy
White chick that be in the show with all them doctors
Know what I'm saying? The name control the ball like gridiron
Speech, diction, syntax is triple A rated
And it's not how he talk it, who he talk to
To all y'all that hate, keep your mouth closed
(DOOM!) Watch the mask and you'll see
And say your prayers, like "Boom! He's back!"
You won't see me, I disappear like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
Boogie blow, snatch the dough then split like Houdini
Like a palm tree in Africa, can't stand still
With the metal mask, give him mad-r'dic skills
Like Kung Fu, uncanny too and always get it poppin'
Always gone, always goon, on the road that's how it seem
Seriously, he be writing on the tour like Forrest Gump
Went to dinner with the 'mentor', it was crazy dude
He gave him advice, he told him what life was about
We got beef with Jim Crow and don't forget
The name is DOOM, the mask gives him powers
